  <h2>최근 영화를 본 경험;<br>Talk about a recent movie you watched.</h2>
  <p>I recently watched a korean movie called <a href="https://movie.naver.com/movie/bi/mi/basic.nhn?code=141104" target="_blank" title="tunnel information"><strong>"Tunnel."</strong></a> The movie was about a <strong><u>tragic</u> accident</strong> in a tunnel and how a survivor <strong>was saved</strong> after 35 days. It starred one of my favorite actors. It was really fun. The movie was packed with nerve-racking scenes. I really liked the storyline of that movie. I liked the big twist at the end. I also liked the acting and the message of the movie. There were many great lines in the movie.</p>

  <p>I personally don't like disater movie, but this one was okay. The movie did very well at the box office. Over roll, it was one of the most memorable movies that I have watched recently.</p>
