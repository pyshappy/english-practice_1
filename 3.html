  <h2>시력이 나빠진 경험;<br>Talk about when your eyesight got worse.</h2>
  <p>I have very poor eyesight. Without my glasses, I'm as blind as a bat. I have to squint my eyes to see things. I always sit in the front row for class. I tried to wear contacts. However, they hurt my eyes. I have no choice but to wear glasses around the clock.</p>
  <p>Recently, I had troble seeing clearly. It was so bad, I couldn't get my work done. I went to get an eye exam. I got a new glasses with a stronger prescription. I would like to get eyesight correction surgery. Many of my friends have gotten laser surgery on their eyes. However, my advised against it. She couldn't guarantee success.</p>
