  <h2>치아 교정을 해 본 경험;<br>Talk about when you got dental braces.</h2>
  <p>I'm an average-looking person. However, I do have crooked theeth. These days, good teeth are considered important. They are a big part of someone's first impression. The problem is that dental braces are very pricey. Usually, they are not covered by insurance. Also, they take a lot of time to work. It can takes two years to see the effects.</p>
  <p>However, I decided to get braces. I didn't expect them to be so painful. They also get in the way when I eat. Bits of food always get stuck in the wires. However, I am willing to endure it. It's the price to pay to feel confident when I smile.</p>
